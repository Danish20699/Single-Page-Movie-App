## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

You need to install
Installed NPM Packages:
Redux Toolkit - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxj...
React Redux - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-r...
Axios - https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-r...
React Player - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-p...
Dayjs - https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs
React Router DOM - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-r...
React Icons - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-i...
React Circular Progressbar - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-c...
React Infinite Scroll - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-i...
React Lazy Load Image - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-l...
For Testing API

* [Post Man](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)


### Installing

Create React App
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

You can learn more in the Create React App documentation.

IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition:
These instructions will help you build IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition from source code, which is the basis for IntelliJ Platform development. The following conventions will be used to refer to directories on your machine:

<USER_HOME> is your home directory.
<IDEA_HOME> is the root directory for the IntelliJ source code.
Getting IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition Source Code
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition source code is available from github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community by either cloning or downloading a zip file (based on a branch) into <IDEA_HOME>. The default is the master branch.

The master branch contains the source code which will be used to create the next major version of IntelliJ IDEA. The branch names and build numbers for older releases of IntelliJ IDEA can be found on the page of Build Number Ranges.

These Git operations can also be done through the IntelliJ IDEA user interface.

Speed Tip: If the complete repository history isn't needed then using a shallow clone (git clone --depth 1) will save significant time.

On Windows: Two git options are required to check out sources on Windows. Since it's a common source of Git issues on Windows anyway, those options could be set globally (execute those commands before cloning any of intellij-community/android repositories):

git config --global core.longpaths true
git config --global core.autocrlf input
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition requires additional Android modules from separate Git repositories. To clone these repositories, run one of the getPlugins scripts located in the <IDEA_HOME> directory. These scripts clone their respective master branches. Make sure you are inside the <IDEA_HOME> directory when running those scripts, so the modules get cloned inside the <IDEA_HOME> directory.

getPlugins.sh for Linux or macOS.
getPlugins.bat for Windows.
Note: Always git checkout the intellij-community and android Git repositories to the same branches/tags.

Building IntelliJ Community Edition
Version 2023.1.1 or newer of IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition is required to build and develop for the IntelliJ Platform.

Opening the IntelliJ Source Code for Build
Using IntelliJ IDEA File | Open, select the <IDEA_HOME> directory.

If IntelliJ IDEA displays an error about a missing or out of date required plugin (e.g. Kotlin), enable, upgrade, or install that plugin and restart IntelliJ IDEA.
IntelliJ Build Configuration
It's recommended to use JetBrains Runtime 17 to compile the project. When you invoke Build Project for the first time, IntelliJ IDEA should suggest downloading it automatically.
If the Maven plugin is disabled, add the path variable "MAVEN_REPOSITORY" pointing to <USER_HOME>/.m2/repository directory.
Make sure you have at least 8GB of RAM on your computer. With the bare minimum of RAM, disable "Compile independent modules in parallel" option in the compiler settings. With notably more memory available, increase "User-local build process heap size" to 3000 - that will greatly reduce compilation time.
Note that it is important to use the variant of JetBrains Runtime without JCEF. So, if for some reason jbr-17 SDK points to an installation of JetBrains Runtime with JCEF, you need to change it: ensure that IntelliJ IDEA is running in internal mode (by adding idea.is.internal=true to idea.properties file), navigate to jbr-17 item in Project Structure | SDKs, click on 'Browse' button, choose 'Download...' item and select version 17 and vendor 'JetBrains Runtime'.

Building the IntelliJ Application Source Code
To build IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition from source, choose Build | Build Project from the main menu.

To build installation packages, run the installers.cmd command in <IDEA_HOME> directory. installers.cmd will work on both Windows and Unix systems.

Options to build installers are passed as system properties to installers.cmd command. You may find the list of available properties in BuildOptions.kt

Examples (./ should be added only for Linux/macOS):

Build installers only for current operating system: ./installers.cmd -Dintellij.build.target.os=current
Build source code incrementally (do not build what was already built before): ./installers.cmd -Dintellij.build.incremental.compilation=true
installers.cmd is used just to run OpenSourceCommunityInstallersBuildTarget from the command line. You may call it directly from IDEA, see run configuration Build IDEA Community Installers (current OS) for an example.

Dockerized Build Environment
To build installation packages inside a Docker container with preinstalled dependencies and tools, run the following command in <IDEA_HOME> directory (on Windows, use PowerShell):
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/community $(docker build -q . --target build_env)

Running IntelliJ IDEA
To run the IntelliJ IDEA built from source, choose Run | Run from the main menu. This will use the preconfigured run configuration "IDEA".

To run tests on the build, apply these setting to the Run | Edit Configurations... | Templates | JUnit configuration tab:

Working dir: <IDEA_HOME>/bin
VM options:
-ea
You can find other helpful information at https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/idea. The "Contribute Code" section of that site describes how you can contribute to IntelliJ IDEA.

Running IntelliJ IDEA on CI/CD environment
To run tests outside of IntelliJ IDEA, run the tests.cmd command in <IDEA_HOME> directory. tests.cmd will work on both Windows and Unix systems.

Options to run tests are passed as system properties to tests.cmd command. You may find the list of available properties in TestingOptions.kt

Examples (./ should be added only for Linux/macOS):

Build source code incrementally (do not build what was already built before): ./tests.cmd -Dintellij.build.incremental.compilation=true
Run a specific test: ./tests.cmd -Dintellij.build.test.patterns=com.intellij.util.ArrayUtilTest
tests.cmd is used just to run CommunityRunTestsBuildTarget from the command line. You may call it directly from IDEA, see run configuration tests in community for an example.
